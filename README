			Issues
==========================================================
I was having issues with the last character of strings
for single words and strings you have to type ' ' after
it so that the program recognizes a space.

in files i just create a new line after the last word/
character to fix this issue.

the next project i will have this fixed but i am already
late turning this in so i ran out of time to figure it
out
